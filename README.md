Iris Flower Classification 🌸

Mini Machine Learning Experiment
First posted: 2025

📌 Project Overview

This project is a fundamental Machine Learning experiment designed to demonstrate the end-to-end workflow of building a classification model.

Using the famous Iris dataset, I trained a Decision Tree Classifier to distinguish between three species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their petal measurements. This project highlights data preprocessing, model training, and result visualization.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python 3

Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

📊 Results

The model achieved 100% accuracy on the unseen test dataset.

Key Finding: The Decision Tree logic reveals that Petal Length is the most critical feature.

Visualization: The project includes a confusion matrix and a decision tree diagram to visualize the model's "thought process."
