Iris Flower Classification 🌸Mini Machine Learning ExperimentFirst posted: 2025📌 Project OverviewThis project is a fundamental Machine Learning experiment designed to demonstrate the end-to-end workflow of building a classification model.Using the famous Iris dataset, I trained a Decision Tree Classifier to distinguish between three species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their petal measurements. This project highlights data preprocessing, model training, and result visualization.🛠️ Tech StackLanguage: Python 3Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SeabornEnvironment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab📊 ResultsThe model achieved 100% accuracy on the unseen test dataset.Key Finding: The Decision Tree logic reveals that Petal Length is the most critical feature.Visualization: The project includes a confusion matrix and a decision tree diagram to visualize the model's "thought process."(Ensure your result image is in this folder and named image_10dc18.png)🚀 How to RunClone the repository (or download the files).Install dependencies:pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Run the script:python iris_experiment.py
